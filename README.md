#Hot-And-Cold

A translucent layer, changing color by a value, cold meaning the value is  small, hot meaning the value. As the value increases, the more visible a  activity appears.

Hi, so I made a layer prototype of the UI of Social Parking. My goal is to put this interface on top of the map, and eventually have an arrow point on which side the spot is.

To emulate distance, there is a seekbar on the bottom of the page.  Scroll right, and the layer will be more opaque. When you arrive to the spot, a button pops up, which the user will press in order to tell the system that the spot is taken.

95% of the code is C#, and the actual UI is xml with the android framework.
